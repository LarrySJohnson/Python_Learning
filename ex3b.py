# tricky math here watch out. PEMDAS! (I didnt like the answer so i got out a calculator to prove I did the math right and Python was wrong.
# I added 25+30 then divided that by 6. ERROR WILL ROBINSON!!!
# The math should be 30 divided by 6. Then that number added to 25. (PEMDAS). When done this way ( The RIGHT way ) Then Python is right AGAIN!!!
# I hear your voice Danger......smile
# Number of Hens
print("Hens", 25 + 30 / 6 ) #print (55/6)
# Number of Roosters NOTICE!! the math componet prints out a number But later the similar action will produce an Alpha expression not a Numatice one.
print("Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4) #caculator give an entirly different results. Useing % or / sign
# prints the text
print("Now I will count the eggs:")
# prints the answer to the equation as a numeric number.
print(3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6)
# prints out the text
print("Is it true that 3+2 < 5-7?")
# It gets interesting here the answer to the equation prints as an Alpha character
print(3 + 2 < 5 - 7)
# Interesting here also the first text is printed then the answer to the equation. But note the equation is expressed as an
# Alpha charter not a Numatic. WHY!?!?
print("What is 3+2?", 3 + 2)
# same issue as above
print("What is 5-7?", 5 - 7)
# prints text
print("Oh that's why it's False.")
# prints text
print("How about some more.")
# second half of this line prints a true false comment. Again Why? not a Number?
print("Is it greater?", 5 > -2)
